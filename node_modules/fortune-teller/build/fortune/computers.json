  "A certain monk had a habit of pestering the Grand Tortue (the only one who \nhad ever reached the Enlightenment 'Yond Enlightenment), by asking whether \nvarious objects had Buddha-nature or not.  To such a question Tortue \ninvariably sat silent.  The monk had already asked about a bean, a lake, \nand a moonlit night.  One day he brought to Tortue a piece of string, and \nasked the same question.  In reply, the Grand Tortue grasped the loop \nbetween his feet and, with a few simple manipulations, created a complex \nstring which he proferred wordlessly to the monk.  At that moment, the monk \nwas enlightened. \n\nFrom then on, the monk did not bother Tortue.  Instead, he made string after \nstring by Tortue's method; and he passed the method on to his own disciples, \nwho passed it on to theirs.\n",

Remember the last time smoke escaped from your Lucas voltage regulator\nDidn't it quit working?  I sat and smiled like an idiot as more of the truth\ndawned.  It's the wiring harness that carries the smoke from one device to\nanother in your Mini, MG or Jag.  And when the harness springs a leak, it lets\nthe smoke out of everything at once, and then nothing works.  The starter motor\nrequires large quantities of smoke to operate properly, and that's why the wire\ngoing to it is so large.\n\tFeeling very smug, I continued to expand my hypothesis.  Why are Lucas\nelectronics more likely to leak than say Bosch?  Hmmm...  Aha!!!  Lucas is\nBritish, and all things British leak!

With SI:%DSK-GC-QLX-BITS set to 17,\n(NOT the default) the old garbage collection algorithm remains in force; when \nvirtual storage is filled, the machine cold boots itself.  With SI:%DSK-GC-\nQLX-BITS set to 23, the new garbage collector is enabled.  Unlike most garbage\ncollectors, the new gc starts its mark phase from the mind of the user, rather \nthan from the obarray.  This allows the garbage collection of significantly \nmore Qs.  As the garbage collector runs, it may ask you something like \"Do you\nremember what SI:RDTBL-TRANS does?\", and if you can't give a reasonable answer\nin thirty seconds, the symbol becomes a candidate for GCing.  The variable \nSI:%GC-QLX-LUSER-TM governs how long the GC waits before timing out the user.\n",

  "... an anecdote from IBM's Yorktown Heights Research Center.  When a\nprogrammer used his new computer terminal, all was fine when he was sitting\ndown, but he couldn't log in to the system when he was standing up.  That\nbehavior was 100 percent repeatable: he could always log in when sitting and\nnever when standing.\n\nMost of us just sit back and marvel at such a story; how could that terminal\nknow whether the poor guy was sitting or standing?  Good debuggers, though,\nknow that there has to be a reason.  Electrical theories are the easiest to\nhypothesize: was there a loose with under the carpet, or problems with static\nelectricity?  But electrical problems are rarely consistently reproducible.\nAn alert IBMer finally noticed that the problem was in the terminal's keyboard:\nthe tops of two keys were switched.  When the programmer was seated he was a\ntouch typist and the problem went unnoticed, but when he stood he was led\nastray by hunting and pecking.\n\t-- \"Programming Pearls\" column, by Jon Bentley in CACM February 1985\n",

Post Center of Long\nIsland University, Hopper told a group of Long Island public school adminis-\ntrators that the first computer \"bug\" was a real bug--a moth.  At Harvard\none August night in 1945, Hopper and her associates were working on the\n\"granddaddy\" of modern computers, the Mark I.  \"Things were going badly;\nthere was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long glass-enclosed\ncomputer,\" she said.  \"Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, using\nordinary tweezers, removed the problem, a two-inch moth.  From then on, when\nanything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it.\"  Hopper\nsaid that when the veracity of her story was questioned recently, \"I referred\nthem to my 1945 log book, now in the collection of the Naval Surface Weapons\nCenter, and they found the remains of that moth taped to the page in\nquestion.\"\n\t\t[actually, the term \"bug\" had even earlier usage in\n\t\tregard to problems with radio hardware.

But if\nyou also want to use \\skip12 for horizontal glue, whether in math mode or\nnot, the amount of skipping will be in points (e.g., 6pt).

But, notwithstanding the sacrifice of these advantages\nfor the purpose of maturing an engine of almost intellectual power, and\nafter expending from my own private fortune a larger sum than the government\nof England has spent on that machine, the execution of which it only\ncommenced, I have received neither an acknowledgement of my labors, not even\nthe offer of those honors or rewards which are allowed to fall within the\nreach of men who devote themselves to purely scientific investigations...\n\tIf the work upon which I have bestowed so much time and thought were\na mere triumph over mechanical difficulties, or simply curious, or if the\nexecution of such engines were of doubtful practicability or utility, some\njustification might be found for the course which has been taken; but I\nventure to assert that no mathematician who has a reputation to lose will\never publicly express an opinion that such a machine would be useless if\nmade, and that no man distinguished as a civil engineer will venture to\ndeclare the construction of such machinery impracticable...\n\tAnd at a period when the progress of physical science is obstructed\nby that exhausting intellectual and manual labor, indispensable for its\nadvancement, which it is the object of the Analytical Engine to relieve, I\nthink the application of machinery in aid of the most complicated and abtruse\ncalculations can no longer be deemed unworthy of the attention of the country.\nIn fact, there is no reason why mental as well as bodily labor should not\nbe economized by the aid of machinery.\n\t\t-- Charles Babbage, \"The Life of a Philosopher\"\n",

Asked whether he was worried about the\nforeign influence in an expensive American Dream, the vice president\nsaid, ``Finland?  Oh, we've already bought them, but we haven't told\nanyone yet.  They're great at building model airplanes as well.  And _\bI\ncan spell potato.''  House representatives are not mollified, however,\nwanting to see the terms of the deal first, fearing another Alaska.\n\tRumors about the SAG release have imbalanced the American stock\nmarket for weeks.

  "`Lasu' Releases SAG 0.3 -- Freeware Book Takes Paves For New World Order\nby staff writers\n\nHelsinki, Finland, August 6, 1995 -- In a surprise movement, Lars\n``Lasu'' Wirzenius today released the 0.3 edition of the ``Linux System\nAdministrators' Guide''.  Already an industry non-classic, the new\nversion sports such overwhelming features as an overview of a Linux\nsystem, a completely new climbing session in a tree, and a list of\nacknowledgements in the introduction.\n\tThe SAG, as the book is affectionately called, is one of the\ncorner stones of the Linux Documentation Project.  ``We at the LDP feel\nthat we wouldn't be able to produce anything at all, that all our work\nwould be futile, if it weren't for the SAG,'' says Matt Welsh, director\nof LDP, Inc.\n\tThe new version is still distributed freely, now even with a\ncopyright that allows modification.  ``More dough,'' explains the author.\nDespite insistent rumors about blatant commercialization, the SAG will\nprobably remain free.  ``Even more dough,'' promises the author.\n\tThe author refuses to comment on Windows NT and Windows 96\nversions, claiming not to understand what the question is about.\nIndustry gossip, however, tells that Bill Gates, co-founder and CEO of\nMicrosoft, producer of the Windows series of video games, has visited\nHelsinki several times this year.  Despite of this, Linus Torvalds,\nauthor of the word processor Linux with which the SAG was written, is\nnot worried.  ``We'll have world domination real soon now, anyway,'' he\nexplains, ``for 1.4 at the lastest.''\n\t...\n\t\t-- Lars Wirzenius <wirzeniu@cs.helsinki.fi>\n\t\t   [comp.os.linux.announce]\n",

  "Norbert Weiner was the subject of many dotty professor stories.  Weiner was, in\nfact, very absent minded.  The following story is told about him: when they\nmoved from Cambridge to Newton his wife, knowing that he would be absolutely\nuseless on the move, packed him off to MIT while she directed the move.  Since\nshe was certain that he would forget that they had moved and where they had\nmoved to, she wrote down the new address on a piece of paper, and gave it to\nhim.  Naturally, in the course of the day, an insight occurred to him.  He\nreached in his pocket, found a piece of paper on which he furiously scribbled\nsome notes, thought it over, decided there was a fallacy in his idea, and\nthrew the piece of paper away.  At the end of the day he went home (to the\nold address in Cambridge, of course).  When he got there he realized that they\nhad moved, that he had no idea where they had moved to, and that the piece of\npaper with the address was long gone.  Fortunately inspiration struck.  There\nwas a young girl on the street and he conceived the idea of asking her where\nhe had moved to, saying, \"Excuse me, perhaps you know me.  I'm Norbert Weiner\nand we've just moved.  Would you know where we've moved to?\"  To which the\nyoung girl replied, \"Yes, Daddy, Mommy thought you would forget.\"\n\tThe capper to the story is that I asked his daughter (the girl in the\nstory) about the truth of the story, many years later.

It's great for students, great for somewhat casual\nusers, and it's great for interchanging programs between different machines.\nAnd so, because of its popularity in these markets, we support it.  We have\ngood UNIX on VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.\n\tIt is our belief, however, that serious professional users will run\nout of things they can do with UNIX. They'll want a real system and will end\nup doing VMS when they get to be serious about programming.\n\tWith UNIX, if you're looking for something, you can easily and quickly\ncheck that small manual and find out that it's not there.  With VMS, no matter\nwhat you look for -- it's literally a five-foot shelf of documentation -- if\nyou look long enough it's there.

  "\t\t\t\tSEMINAR ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nTitle:\t\tAre Frogs Turing Compatible?\nSpeaker:\tDon \"The Lion\" Knuth\n\n\t\t\t\tABSTRACT\n\tSeveral researchers at the University of Louisiana have been studying\nthe computing power of various amphibians, frogs in particular.  The problem\nof frog computability has become a critical issue that ranges across all areas\nof computer science.  It has been shown that anything computable by an amphi-\nbian community in a fixed-size pond is computable by a frog in the same-size\npond -- that is to say, frogs are Pond-space complete.  We will show that\nthere is a log-space, polywog-time reduction from any Turing machine program\nto a frog.  We will suggest these represent a proper subset of frog-computable\nfunctions.\n\tThis is not just a let's-see-how-far-those-frogs-can-jump seminar.\nThis is only for hardcore amphibian-computation people and their colleagues.\n\tRefreshments will be served.

  "***** Special AI Seminar (abstract)\n\nIt has been widely recognized that AI programs require expert knowledge \nin order to perform well in complex domains.  But knowledge alone is not\nsufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.  Accordingly, \nwe have developed a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call \n\"wisdom engineering\".  As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a \nwisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.  \nIMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom \nabout such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so \nforth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic \nrules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL \nsucceeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed \nin western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those \nunderlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theory\nof value, and Husserl's phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will describe \nIMMANUEL's achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly \ndiscuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.\n",

  "\tTHE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #10: SIMPLE\n\nSIMPLE is an acronym for Sheer Idiot's Monopurpose Programming Language\nEnvironment.  This language, developed at the Hanover College for\nTechnological Misfits, was designed to make it impossible to write code\nwith errors in it.  The statements are, therefore, confined to BEGIN,\nEND and STOP.  No matter how you arrange the statements, you can't make\na syntax error.  Programs written in SIMPLE do nothing useful.

In the 16th century the printed book helped\nmake possible the split between Catholics and Protestants.  In the 20th\ncentury this history of tragedy and triumph is repeating itself as a farce.\nThose who worship the Apple computer and those who put their faith in the IBM\nPC are equally convinced that the other camp is damned or deluded.
