  "\tMost of what I really need to know about how to live, and what to do,\nand how to be, I learned in kindergarten.  Wisdom was not at the top of the\ngraduate school mountain but there in the sandbox at nursery school.\n\tThese are the things I learned:  Share everything.  Play fair.  Don't\nhit people.  Put things back where you found them.  Clean up your own mess.\nDon't take things that aren't yours.   Say you're sorry when you hurt someone.\nWash your hands before you eat.  Flush.  Warm cookies and cold milk are good\nfor you.  Live a balanced life.  Learn some and think some and draw and paint\nand sing and dance and play and work some every day.\n\tTake a nap every afternoon.  When you go out into the world, watch for\ntraffic, hold hands, and stick together.  Be aware of wonder.  Remember the\nlittle seed in the plastic cup.   The roots go down and the plant goes up and\nnobody really knows how or why, but we are all like that.  Goldfish and\nhamsters and white mice and even the little seed in the plastic cup -- they all\ndie.  So do we.\n\tAnd then remember the book about Dick and Jane and the first word you\nlearned, the biggest word of all: LOOK.  Everything you need to know is in\nthere somewhere.  The Golden Rule and love and basic sanitation.  Ecology and\npolitics and sane living.\n\tThink of what a better world it would be if we all -- the whole world\n-- had cookies and milk about 3 o'clock every afternoon and then lay down with\nour blankets for a nap.  Or if we had a basic policy in our nation and other\nnations to always put things back where we found them and cleaned up our own\nmesses.

  "\tWell, he thought, since neither Aristotelian Logic nor the disciplines\nof Science seemed to offer much hope, it's time to go beyond them...\n\tDrawing a few deep even breaths, he entered a mental state practiced\nonly by Masters of the Universal Way of Zen.  In it his mind floated freely,\nable to rummage at will among the bits and pieces of data he had absorbed,\nundistracted by any outside disturbances.  Logical structures no longer\ninhibited him. Pre-conceptions, prejudices, ordinary human standards vanished.\nAll things, those previously trivial as well as those once thought important,\nbecame absolutely equal by acquiring an absolute value, revealing relationships\nnot evident to ordinary vision.  Like beads strung on a string of their own\nmeaning, each thing pointed to its own common ground of existence, shared by\nall.  Finally, each began to melt into each, staying itself while becoming\nall others.  And Mind no longer contemplated Problem, but became Problem,\ndestroying Subject-Object by becoming them.\n\tTime passed, unheeded.\n\tEventually, there was a tentative stirring, then a decisive one, and\nNakamura arose, a smile on his face and the light of laughter in his eyes.\n\t\t-- Wayfarer\n",

At the same time, you feel sure that in all\nthe wilderness of possibility; in all the forests of opinion, there is a\nvital something that can be known -- known and grasped.  That we will\neventually know it, and convert the whole mystery into a coherent\nnarrative.  So that then one's true life -- the point of everything --\nwill emerge from the mist into a pure light, into total comprehension.\nBut it isn't like that at all.
