  "Fortune's Rules for Memo Wars: #2\n\nGiven the incredible advances in sociocybernetics and telepsychology over\nthe last few years, we are now able to completely understand everything that\nthe author of an memo is trying to say.  Thanks to modern developments\nin electrocommunications like notes, vnews, and electricity, we have an\nincredible level of interunderstanding the likes of which civilization has\nnever known.  Thus, the possibility of your misinterpreting someone else's\nmemo is practically nil.  Knowing this, anyone who accuses you of having\ndone so is a liar, and should be treated accordingly.  If you *do* understand\nthe memo in question, but have absolutely nothing of substance to say, then\nyou have an excellent opportunity for a vicious ad hominem attack.  In fact,\nthe only *inappropriate* times for an ad hominem attack are as follows:\n\n\t1: When you agree completely with the author of an memo.\n\t2: When the author of the original memo is much bigger than you are.\n\t3: When replying to one of your own memos.\n",

  "Lemma:  All horses are the same color.\nProof (by induction):\n\tCase n = 1: In a set with only one horse, it is obvious that all\n\thorses in that set are the same color.\n\tCase n = k: Suppose you have a set of k+1 horses.  Pull one of these\n\thorses out of the set, so that you have k horses.  Suppose that all\n\tof these horses are the same color.  Now put back the horse that you\n\ttook out, and pull out a different one.  Suppose that all of the k\n\thorses now in the set are the same color.  Then the set of k+1 horses\n\tare all the same color.  We have k true => k+1 true; therefore all\n\thorses are the same color.\nTheorem: All horses have an infinite number of legs.\nProof (by intimidation):\n\tEveryone would agree that all horses have an even number of legs.  It\n\tis also well-known that horses have forelegs in front and two legs in\n\tback.  4 + 2 = 6 legs, which is certainly an odd number of legs for a\n\thorse to have!  Now the only number that is both even and odd is\n\tinfinity; therefore all horses have an infinite number of legs.\n\tHowever, suppose that there is a horse somewhere that does not have an\n\tinfinite number of legs.  Well, that would be a horse of a different\n\tcolor; and by the Lemma, it doesn't exist.\n",

Verbs have to agree with\ntheir subjects.  Proofread carefully to see if you words out.  If you reread\nyour work, you can find on rereading a great deal of repetition can be\navoided by rereading and editing.  A writer must not shift your point of\nview.  And don't start a sentence with a conjunction.  (Remember, too, a\npreposition is a terrible word to end a sentence with.) Don't overuse\nexclamation marks!!  Place pronouns as close as possible, especially in long\nsentences, as of 10 or more words, to their antecedents.  Writing carefully,\ndangling participles must be avoided.  If any word is improper at the end of\na sentence, a linking verb is.  Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing\nmetaphors.  Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.  Everyone should be\ncareful to use a singular pronoun with singular nouns in their writing.\nAlways pick on the correct idiom.  The adverb always follows the verb.  Last\nbut not least, avoid cliches like the plague; seek viable alternatives.\n",
