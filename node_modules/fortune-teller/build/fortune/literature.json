This was the line that opened his novel, \"Paul Clifford,\"\nwritten in 1830.  The full line reveals why it is so bad:\n\n\tIt was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents -- except\n\tat occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of\n\twind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene\n\tlies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty\n\tflame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.\n",
