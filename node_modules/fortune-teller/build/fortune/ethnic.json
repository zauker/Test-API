  "\tThe world's most avid baseball fan (an Aggie) had arrived at the\nstadium for the first game of the World Series only to realize he had left\nhis ticket at home.  Not wanting to miss any of the first inning, he went\nto the ticket booth and got in a long line for another seat.  After an hour's\nwait he was just a few feet from the booth when a voice called out, \"Hey,\nDave!\"  The Aggie looked up, stepped out of line and tried to find the owner\nof the voice -- with no success.   Then he realized he had lost his place in\nline and had to wait all over again.  When the fan finally bought his ticket,\nhe was thirsty, so he went to buy a drink.  The line at the concession stand\nwas long, too, but since the game hadn't started he decided to wait.  Just as\nhe got to the window, a voice called out, \"Hey, Dave!\"  Again the Aggie tried\nto find the voice -- but no luck.  He was very upset as he got back in line\nfor his drink.  Finally the fan went to his seat, eager for the game to begin.\nAs he waited for the pitch, he heard the voice calling, \"Hey Dave!\" once more.\nFurious, he stood up and yelled at the top of his lungs,  \"My name isn't Dave!\"\n",
