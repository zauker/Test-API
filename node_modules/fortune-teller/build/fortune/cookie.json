  "It is a very humbling experience to make a multimillion-dollar mistake, but it\nis also very memorable.  I vividly recall the night we decided how to organize\nthe actual writing of external specifications for OS/360.

He asserted that they could write\nthe specifications and do it right.  It would take ten months, three more\nthan the schedule allowed.\n\nThe control program manager had 150 men.  He asserted that they could prepare\nthe specifications, with the architecture team coordinating; it would be \nwell-done and practical, and he could do it on schedule.  Futhermore, if\nthe architecture team did it, his 150 men would sit twiddling their thumbs\nfor ten months.\n\nTo this the architecture manager responded that if I gave the control program\nteam the responsibility, the result would not in fact be on time, but would\nalso be three months late, and of much lower quality.  I did, and it was.  He\nwas right on both counts.  Moreover, the lack of conceptual integrity made\nthe system far more costly to build and change, and I would estimate that it\nadded a year to debugging time.\n- Frederick Brooks Jr., \"The Mythical Man Month\" \n",

Something happens between first and twelfth grade,\nand it's not just puberty.  Not only do the schools and the media not teach\nmuch skepticism, there is also little encouragement of this stirring sense\nof wonder.  Science and pseudoscience both arouse that feeling.

Every newspaper\nin America has a daily astrology column.  How many have even a weekly\nastronomy column?  And I believe it is also the fault of the educational\nsystem.

  "...One thing is that, unlike any other Western democracy that I know of,\nthis country has operated since its beginnings with a basic distrust of \ngovernment.  We are constituted not for efficient operation of government,\nbut for minimizing the possibility of abuse of power.  It took the events\nof the Roosevelt era -- a catastrophic economic collapse and a world war --\nto introduce the strong central government that we now know.  But in most\nparts of the country today, the reluctance to have government is still\nstrong.  I think, barring a series of catastrophic events, that we can\nlook to at least another decade during which many of the big problems\naround this country will have to be addressed by institutions other than\nfederal government.\n- Bobby R.

Others view it as nothing\nbut a cold, dry narrow, plodding, rule-bound process -- the scientific\nmethod: hidebound, linear, and left brained.\n\nThese people are the victims of their own stereotypes.

  "A serious public debate about the validity of astrology?  A serious believer\nin the White House?  Two of them?  Give me a break.  What stifled my laughter\nis that the image fits.  Reagan has always exhibited a fey indifference toward\nscience.  Facts, like numbers, roll off his back.  And we've all come to\naccept it.  This time it was stargazing that became a serious issue....Not\nthat long ago, it was Reagan's support of Creationism....Creationists actually\ngot equal time with evolutionists.  The public was supposed to be open-minded\nto the claims of paleontologists and fundamentalists, as if the two were\nscientific colleagues....It has been clear for a long time that the president\nis averse to science...In general, these attitudes fall onto friendly American\nturf....But at the outer edges, this skepticism about science easily turns\ninto a kind of naive acceptance of nonscience, or even nonsense.

  "[Astrology is] 100 percent hokum, Ted.  As a matter of fact, the first edition\nof the Encyclopaedia Britannica, written in 1771 -- 1771! -- said that this\nbelief system is a subject long ago ridiculed and reviled.  We're dealing with\nbeliefs that go back to the ancient Babylonians.  There's nothing there....\nIt sounds a lot like science, it sounds like astronomy.  It's got technical\nterms.  It's got jargon.  It confuses the public....The astrologer is quite\nglib, confuses the public, uses terms which come from science, come from\nmetaphysics, come from a host of fields, but they really mean nothing.  The\nfact is that astrological beliefs go back at least 2,500 years.  Now that\nshould be a sufficiently long time for astrologers to prove their case.  They\nhave not proved their case....It's just simply gibberish.  The fact is, there's\nno theory for it, there are no observational data for it.  It's been tested\nand tested over the centuries.  Nobody's ever found any validity to it at\nall.  It is not even close to a science.  A science has to be repeatable, it\nhas to have a logical foundation, and it has to be potentially vulnerable --\nyou test it.  And in that astrology is reqlly quite something else.\n-- Astronomer Richard Berendzen, President, American University, on ABC\n    News \"Nightline,\" May 3, 1988\n",
  "Even if we put all these nagging thoughts [four embarrassing questions about\nastrology] aside for a moment, one overriding question remains to be asked.\nWhy would the positions of celestial objects at the moment of birth have an\neffect on our characters, lives, or destinies?  What force or influence,\nwhat sort of energy would travel from the planets and stars to all human\nbeings and affect our development or fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding\njargon or computerized calculations by astrologers can disguise this central\nproblem with astrology -- we can find no evidence of a mechanism by which\ncelestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .\nSome astrologers argue that there may be a still unknown force that represents\nthe astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predictions -- like those\nof any scientific field -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always\nclaim to be just a little too busy to carry out such careful tests of their\nefficacy, so in the last two decades scientists and statisticians have\ngenerously done such testing for them.  There have been dozens of well-designed\ntests all around the world, and astrology has failed every one of them. . . .\nI propose that we let those beckoning lights in the sky awaken our interest\nin the real (and fascinating) universe beyond our planet, and not let them\nkeep us tied to an ancient fantasy left over from a time when we huddled by\nthe firelight, afraid of the night.\n-- Andrew Fraknoi, Executive Officer, Astronomical Society of the Pacific,\n    \"Why Astrology Believers Should Feel Embarrassed,\" San Jose Mercury\n    News, May 8, 1988\n",
  "With the news that Nancy Reagan has referred to an astrologer when planning\nher husband's schedule, and reports of Californians evacuating Los Angeles\non the strength of a prediction from a sixteenth-century physician and\nastrologer Michel de Notredame, the image of the U.S. as a scientific and\ntechnological nation has taking a bit of a battering lately.  Sadly, such\nhappenings cannot be dismissed as passing fancies.  They are manifestations\nof a well-established \"anti-science\" tendency in the U.S. which, ultimately,\ncould threaten the country's position as a technological power. . . .  The\nmanifest widespread desire to reject rationality and substitute a series\nof quasirandom beliefs in order to understand the universe does not augur\nwell for a nation deeply concerned about its ability to compete with its\nindustrial equals.  To the degree that it reflects the thinking of a \nsignificant section of the public, this point of view encourages ignorance\nof and, indeed, contempt for science and for rational methods of approaching\ntruth. . . . It is becoming clear that if the U.S. does not pick itself up\nsoon and devote some effort to educating the young effectively, its hope of\nmaintaining a semblance of leadership in the world may rest, paradoxically,\nwith a new wave of technically interested and trained immigrants who do not\nsuffer from the anti-science disease rampant in an apparently decaying society.\n-- Physicist Tony Feinberg, in \"New Scientist,\" May 19, 1988\n",
