Federal cutbacks mean less money for fortunes, and unless\nuser contributions increase to make up the difference, the fortune program\nwill have to shut down between midnight and 8 a.m.  Don't let this happen.\nMail your fortunes right now to \"fortune\".  Just type in your favorite pithy\nsaying.  Do it now before you forget.  Our target is 300 new fortunes by the\nend of the week. Don't miss out.  All fortunes will be acknowledged.
