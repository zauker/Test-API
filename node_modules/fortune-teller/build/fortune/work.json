  "One promising concept that I came up with right away was that you could\nmanufacture personal air bags, then get a law passed requiring that they be\ninstalled on congressmen to keep them from taking trips.  Let's say your\ncongressman was trying to travel to Paris to do a fact-finding study on how\nthe French government handles diseases transmitted by sherbet.  Just when he\ngot to the plane, his mandatory air bag, strapped around his waist, would\ninflate -- FWWAAAAAAPPPP -- thus rendering him too large to fit through the\nplane door.  It could also be rigged to inflate whenever the congressman\nproposed a law.  (\"Mr. Speaker, people ask me, why should October be\ndesignated as Cuticle Inspection Month?  And I answer that FWWAAAAAAPPPP.\")\nThis would save millions of dollars, so I have no doubt that the public\nwould violently support a law requiring airbags on congressmen.  The problem\nis that your potential market is very small: there are only around 500\nmembers of Congress, and some of them, such as House Speaker \"Tip\" O'Neil,\nare already too large to fit on normal aircraft.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"'Mister Mediocre' Restaurants\"\n",
