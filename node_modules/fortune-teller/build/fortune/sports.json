  "A [golf] ball hitting a tree shall be deemed not to have hit the tree.\nHitting a tree is simply bad luck and has no place in a scientific game.\nThe player should estimate the distance the ball would have traveled if it\nhad not hit the tree and play the ball from there, preferably atop a nice\nfirm tuft of grass.\n\t\t-- Donald A.
