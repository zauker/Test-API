In 1803 three attempts were\nmade to hang a Mr. Joseph Samuels.  On the first two of these the rope\nsnapped, while on the third Mr. Samuels just hung there peacefully until he\nand everyone else got bored.  Since he had proved unsusceptible to capital\npunishment, he was reprieved.\n\tThe most important British executioner was Mr. James Berry who\ntried three times in 1885 to hang Mr. John Lee at Exeter Jail, but on each\noccasion failed to get the trap door open.\n\tIn recognition of this achievement, the Home Secretary commuted\nLee's sentence to \"life\" imprisonment.  He was released in 1917, emigrated\nto America and lived until 1933.\n\t\t-- Stephen Pile, \"The Book of Heroic Failures\"\n",

He consistently refused to do anything which might ruffle or\noffend the criminal classes.\n\tHis handling officer, Rick Grim, had to admit: \"He just won't go up\nand bite them.  I got sick and tired of doing that dog's work for him.\"\n\tThe British contenders in this category, however, took things a\nstage further.  \"Laddie\" and \"Boy\" were trained as detector dogs for drug\nraids.  Their employment was terminated following a raid in the Midlands in\n1967.\n\tWhile the investigating officer questioned two suspects, they\npatted and stroked the dogs who eventually fell asleep in front of the\nfire.
