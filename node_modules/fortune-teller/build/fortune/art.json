  "\tSo Richard and I decided to try to catch [the small shark].\nWith a great deal of strategy and effort and shouting, we managed to\nmaneuver the shark, over the course of about a half-hour, to a sort of\ncorner of the lagoon, so that it had no way to escape other than to\nflop up onto the land and evolve.  Richard and I were inching toward\nit, sort of crouched over, when all of a sudden it turned around and --\nI can still remember the sensation I felt at that moment, primarily in\nthe armpit area -- headed right straight toward us.\n\tMany people would have panicked at this point.  But Richard and\nI were not \"many people.\"  We were experienced waders, and we kept our\nheads.  We did exactly what the textbook says you should do when you're\nunarmed and a shark that is nearly two feet long turns on you in water\nup to your lower calves: We sprinted I would say 600 yards in the\nopposite direction, using a sprinting style such that the bottoms of\nour feet never once went below the surface of the water.  We ran all\nthe way to the far shore, and if we had been in a Warner Brothers\ncartoon we would have run right INTO the beach, and you would have seen\nthese two mounds of sand racing across the island until they bonked\ninto trees and coconuts fell onto their heads.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"The Wonders of Sharks on TV\"\n",

  "\tThe big problem with pornography is defining it.  You can't just\nsay it's pictures of people naked.  For example, you have these\nprimitive African tribes that exist by chasing the wildebeest on foot,\nand they have to go around largely naked, because, as the old tribal\nsaying goes: \"N'wam k'honi soit qui mali,\" which means, \"If you think\nyou can catch a wildebeest in this climate and wear clothes at the same\ntime, then I have some beach front property in the desert region of\nNorthern Mali that you may be interested in.\"\n\tSo it's not considered pornographic when National Geographic\npublishes color photographs of these people hunting the wildebeest\nnaked, or pounding one rock onto another rock for some primitive reason\nnaked, or whatever.

  "The Worst Musical Trio\n\tThere are few bad musicians who have a chance to give a recital at\na famous concert hall while still learning the rudiments of their\ninstrument.  This happened about thirty years ago to the son of a Rumanian\ngentleman who was owed a personal favour by Georges Enesco, the celebrated\nviolinist.  Enesco agreed to give lessons to the son who was quite\nunhampered by great musical talent.\n\tThree years later the boy's father insisted that he give a public\nconcert.  \"His aunt said that nobody plays the violin better than he does.\nA cousin heard him the other day and screamed with enthusiasm.\"  Although\nEnesco feared the consequences, he arranged a recital at the Salle Gaveau\nin Paris.  However, nobody bought a ticket since the soloist was unknown.\n\t\"Then you must accompany him on the piano,\" said the boy's father,\n\"and it will be a sell out.\"\n\tReluctantly, Enesco agreed and it was.  On the night an excited\naudience gathered.  Before the concert began Enesco became nervous and\nasked for someone to turn his pages.\n\tIn the audience was Alfred Cortot, the brilliant pianist, who\nvolunteered and made his way to the stage.\n\tThe soloist was of uniformly low standard and next morning the\nmusic critic of Le Figaro wrote: \"There was a strange concert at the Salle\nGaveau last night.

It involves a sense of future, a belief\nthat every exit line is an entry, that we are moving on, rather than out.\nThe trick of retiring well may be the trick of living well.  It's hard to\nrecognize that life isn't a holding action, but a process.  It's hard to\nlearn that we don't leave the best parts of ourselves behind, back in the\ndugout or the office.
