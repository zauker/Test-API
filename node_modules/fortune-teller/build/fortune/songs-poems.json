  "The Worst American Poet\n\tJulia Moore, \"the Sweet Singer of Michigan\" (1847-1920) was so bad that\nMark Twain said her first book gave him joy for 20 years.\n\tHer verse was mainly concerned with violent death -- the great fire\nof Chicago and the yellow fever epidemic proved natural subjects for her pen.\n\tWhether death was by drowning, by fits or by runaway sleigh, the\nformula was the same:\n\t\tHave you heard of the dreadful fate\n\t\tOf Mr. P.P.

  "Whenever Richard Cory went downtown,\n\tWe people on the pavement looked at him:\nHe was a gentleman from sole to crown,\n\tClean-favored, and imperially slim.\nAnd he was always quietly arrayed,\n\tAnd he was always human when he talked;\nBut still he fluttered pulses when he said,\n\t\"Good morning,\" and he glittered when he walked.\nAnd he was rich -- yes, richer than a king --\n\tAnd admirably schooled in every grace:\nIn fine, we thought that he was everything\n\tTo make us wish that we were in his place.\nSo on we worked, and waited for the light,\n\tAnd went without the meat, and cursed the bread;\nAnd Richard Cory, one calm summer night,\n\tWent home and put a bullet through his head.\n\t\t-- E.A. Robinson, \"Richard Cory\"\n",

  "Why are you watching\nThe washing machine?\nI love entertainment\nSo long as it's clean.\n\nProfessor Doberman:\n\tWhile the preceding poem is unarguably a change from the guarded \npessimism of \"The Hound of Heaven,\" it cannot be regarded as an unqualified \nimprovement.  Obscurity is of value only when it tends to clarify the poetic\nexperience.  As much as one is compelled to admire the poem's technique, one \nmust question whether its byplay of complex literary allusions does not in \nfact distract from the unity of the whole.  In the final analysis, one \nreceives the distinct impression that the poem's length could safely have \nbeen reduced by a factor of eight or ten without sacrificing any of its\nmeaning.  It is to be hoped that further publication of this poem can be \nsuspended pending a thorough investigation of its potential subversive \nimplications.\n",
