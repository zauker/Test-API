  "Stalin was dying, and summoned Khruschev to his bedside.  Wheezing his last\nwords with difficulty, Stalin tells Khruschev, \"The reins of the country are\nnow in your hands.  But before I go, I want to give you some advice.\"\n\t\"Yes, yes, what is it?\" says Khruschev, impatiently.  Reaching under\nhis pillow, Stalin produced two envelopes labeled #1 and #2.\n\t\"Take these letters,\" he tells Khruschev. \"Keep them safely -- don't\nopen them.  Only if the country is in turmoil and things aren't going well,\nopen the first one.  That'll give you some advice on what to do.  And, if\nafter that, if things start getting REALLY bad, open the second one.\"  And\nwith a gasp Stalin breathed his last.\n\tWell, within a few years Khruschev started having problems --\nunemployment increased, crops failed, people became restless.  He decided it\nwas time to open the first letter.  All it said was: \"Blame everything on me!\"\nSo Khruschev launched a massive deStalinization campaign, and blamed Stalin\nfor all the excesses and purges and ills of the present system.\n\tBut things continued on the downslide, and, finally, after much\ndeliberation, Khruschev opened the second letter.\n\tAll it said was: \"Write two letters.\"\n",

  "WE'RE GOING TO THROW THE MX AWAY AFTER WE BUILD IT.  The MX is really\n[Don't tell anybody!] just a \"bargaining chip\" in the nuclear-arms-\nreduction talks with the Russians.  See, we have a problem with the\nRussians.

If he ever becomes\nPresident, the Russians will deliberately create nuclear crises just so\nthey can gather around the Hot Line with refreshments and listen to\nGeorge talk.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"At Last, the Ultimate Deterrent Against\n\t\t   Political Fallout\"\n",
  "Well, here it is, 1983, so it won't be long before you start reading a lot\nof boring stories about people like Vance Hartke.  Hartke is a governor or\nmayor or something from one of the flatter states, and the reason you'll be\nreading about him is that he's one of the 50 top contenders for the 1984\nDemocratic presidential nomination.  These men will spend the next 18 months\ngoing around the country engaging in the most degrading activities\nimaginable, such as wearing idiot hats and appearing on \"Meet the Press.\"\n\"Meet the Press\" is one of those Sunday morning public interest shows that\nthe public is not the least bit interested in.  It features a panel of\nreporters who ask questions of a guest politician, who wins an Amana home\nfreezer if he can get through the entire show without answering a single\nquestion ...\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"On Presidential Politics\"\n",
  "Well, I would -- if they realized that we -- again if -- if we led them\nback to that stalemate only because our retaliatory power, our seconds,\nor strike at them after our first strike, would be so destructive they\nthey couldn't afford it, that would hold them off.\n\t\t-- President Ronald Reagan, on the MX missile\n",

  "What is truth?  We must adopt a pragmatic definition: it is what is believed\nto be the truth.  A lie that is put across therefore becomes the truth and\nmay, therefore, be justified.

  "When democracy granted democratic methods to us in times of opposition, this\nwas bound to happen in a democratic system.  However, we National Socialists\nnever asserted that we represented a democratic point of view, but we have\ndeclared openly that we used the democratic methods only to gain power and\nthat, after assuming the power, we would deny to our adversaries without any\nconsideration the means which were granted to us in times of our opposition.\n\t\t-- Josef Goebbels\n",

  "\tWhen, in 1964, New Hampshire Republican Senator Norris Cotton announced\nhis support of Bary Goldwater in his state's primary election, he was\nquestioned as to whether this indicated a change of his hitherto \"liberal\"\npolitical views.\n\t\"Well,\" explained Cotton, \"it's like the New Hampshire farmer.

  "Within a month [in 1969] I had met the first of a small but not uninfluential\ncommunity of people who violently opposed SALT for a simple reason: It might\nkeep America from developing a first-strike capability against the Soviet\nUnion.  I'll never forget being lectured by an Air Force colonel about how\nwe should have \"nuked\" the Soviets in late 1940s before they got The Bomb.\nI was told that if SALT would go away, we'd soon have the capability to nuke\nthem again -- and this time we'd use it.\n\t\t-- Roger Molander, former nuclear strategist for the\n\t\t   White House's National Security Council, Washington\n\t\t   Post, 21 March, 1982\n",

  "You buy a judge by weight, like iron in a junk yard.  A justice of the\npeace or a magistrate can be had for a five-dollar bill.  In the\nmunicipal courts, he will cost you ten.  In the circuit or superior\ncourts, he wants fifteen.  The state appellate courts or the state\nsupreme court is on a par with the Federal courts.  By the time a judge\nreaches such courts, he is middle-aged, thick around the middle, fat\nbetween the ears.  He's heavy.
