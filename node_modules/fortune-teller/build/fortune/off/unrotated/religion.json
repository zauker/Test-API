It is the\nessence of all dogmatic faiths to hold that any such \"show-down\" is\nsacrilegious and perverse.  The characteristic of religion, from their point\nof view, is that it is intellectually secret, not public; peculiarly revealed,\nnot generally known; authoritatively declared, not communicated and tested\nin ordinary ways...It is pertinent to point out that, as long as religion\nis conceived as it is now by the great majority of professed religionists,\nthere is something self-contradictory in speaking of education in religion\nin the same sense in which we speak of education in topics where the method\nof free inquiry has made its way.

My own belief in\nGod, then, is just that -- a matter of belief, not knowledge.  My respect\nfor Jesus Christ arises from the fact that He seems to have been the most\nvirtuous inhabitant of Planet Earth.

  "As the recent sightings of bumper stickers reading \"IN CASE OF RAPTURE, THIS\nVEHICLE WILL BE UNMANNED\" have created a great deal of confusion, Fortune\noffers the following excerpts from the 1989 printing of the State of Maryland\nDriver's Handbook:\n\tIf you notice a glorious light in the sky, a sound as of an infinite\nchoir of unearthly voices, and a host of winged beings descending from the\nheavens, do not panic.  If you are on the freeway, move to the shoulder as\nsoon as it is safe to do so, activate your hazard blinkers, and wait for the\nend of the world.  If you are Saved, it is especially important that you do\nthis BEFORE you are carried to your Eternal Reward, in order that your vehicle\nnot become a hazard to others.  Remember, Rapture is the number one cause of\nautomobile accidents during major spiritual upheavals.  You may experience a\nfeeling of discorporation (\"being pulled from one's body\") while driving.  To\nensure the safety of your passengers and other drivers, move to the shoulder\nas soon as you notice any of the following symptoms:\n\t-- An overwhelming sense of peace and happiness.\n\t-- Visions of the faces of deceased family members.\n\t-- A glorious figure in white, beckoning from the end of a tunnel of\nwhite mist (do not confuse this with traffic control or maintainance officers,\nwho wear dark blue and safety orange.)\n\tOnce the feeling has passed, inspect your surroundings.

  "It seems that a rabbi, a priest and a minister decided to go fishing one\nsunny afternoon.  All three climbed into the boat and headed for the middle\nof the lake.  After several hours of relaxation, the minister decided that\n\"nature was calling\", and climbed out of the boat and walked ashore.  In\na few moments, he walked back out to the boat and climbed back in.\n\tThe rabbi was absolutely astonished, but decided not to mention\nthe apparent miracle.\n\tA few minutes later, the priest also decided to go ashore for a\nmoment, and climbed out of the boat, walked to shore, and a few minutes\nlater came back.\n\tBy now the rabbi was in great distress and had begun to doubt his\nbeliefs and wonder if there might be some validity to the Christian\nteachings.  But he immediately reaffirmed the fact that his faith WAS JUST\nAS STRONG as either the priest's or the minister's and decided that anything\nthey could do, with God's help, he could do as well.\n\tThe rabbi then announced that he needed relief and would walk to\nshore.  He climbed out of the boat and went straight to the bottom of the\nlake.  While the rabbi was thrashing about in the water, the priest turned to\nthe minister and said, \"So... do you think we ought to tell him where the\nrocks are?\"\n",
  "It seems that there was this Christian about to be thrown to the lions.  He\nwas shoved into the middle of the arena and the lion was released.  Being\na good Christian, as the lion approached he knelt and prayed, asking God for\nforgiveness for his (few) sins, and begging that the lion might be dissuaded\nfrom eating him for its breakfast.  Much to his dismay, the lion didn't stop\nbut kept coming, getting faster and faster, now almost running, so the\nChristian took off too.  There they were, running around and around the arena,\nthe lion getting closer and the Christian praying harder and harder between\ngasps for breath.  The lions breath was now hot upon his heels and he could\neven feel droplets of the lions saliva splashing on his bare feet.  So he\npulled out all the stops, promising God that if the lion will only spare him,\nhe will devote the rest of his life to spreading the Christian faith,\nforsaking all temptation and possessions.  Suddenly he no longer felt the\nlions breath, no longer heard the great beast's snarls close behind him.\nSlowing to a stop, he turned around and saw the lion on its knees, eyes rolled\nupward, paws held together.  The lion appeared to be muttering something so\nthe Christian approached until he could make out what the lion was saying.\n\n\"Dear Lord, for what I am about to receive...\"\n",

One night,\nthe boy ended his prayers with, \"God specially bless Granddad, who won't be\nwith us much longer.\"  The man thought this was rather curious, but passed it\noff as childish whimsy.  The next day, however, he received a call from his\nmother, informing him that his father had passed away early that morning.\nDuring the next few weeks, he listened particularly closely to his son's\nprayers, but noticed nothing unusual.  Then, one night, the boy ended his\nprayers with, \"God specially bless Grandmom, who won't be with us much longer.\"\nAlthough the shock of the original incident had worn off during the intervening\nweeks, he nontheless phoned his mother to inquire as to her health.  He went to\nbed reassured, only to be awakened in the night by his sister calling with the\nnews that their mother had died suddenly in the night.  The father had a series\nof psychological tests done; nothing unusual was uncovered.  About a month \nlater, the boy ended his prayers with, \"God specially bless Daddy, who won't\nbe with us much longer.\"  The man was panic-stricken, certain that he was \ngoing to die during the night.  He resolved to stay awake all night; if awake \nand alert he should be able to prevent any tragedy.  Morning came.  Breathing\na huge sigh of relief, he went to get the paper off the porch.  There, lying\ndead on the doorstep, was the milkman.\n",

  "TO THOSE OF YOU WHO DESIRE IT, I GRANT YOU MADRAK'S BLESSING:\n\n\tInsofar as I may be heard by anything, which may or may not care\nwhat I say, I ask, if it matters, that you be forgiven for anything you\nmay have done or failed to do which requires forgiveness.\n\tConversely, if not forgiveness but something else be required\nto insure any possible benefit for which you may be eligible after the\ndestruction of your body, I ask that this, whatever it may be, be granted\nor withheld, as the case may be, in such a manner as to insure your\nreceving said benefit.\n\tI ask this in my capacity as your elected intermediary between\nyourself and that which may have an interest in the matter of your receving\nas much as it is possible for you to receive of this thing, and which may\nin some way be influenced by this ceremony.\n\tAmen.\n\t\t-- Roger Zelazny, \"Creatures of Light and Darkness\"\n",

  "We ... make the modern error of dignifying the Individual.  We do everything\nwe can to butter him up.  We give him a name, assure him that he has certain\ninalienable rights, educate him, let him pass on his name to his brats and\nwhen he dies we give him a special hole in the ground ... But after all, he's\nonly  a seed, a bloom and a withering stalk among pressing billions.  Your\nIndividual is a pretty disgusting, vain, lewd little bastard ... By God,\nhe has only one right guaranteed him in Nature, and that is the right to die\nand stink to Heaven.\n\t\t-- Ross Lockridge, quoted in \"Short Lives\" by Katinka Matson\n",
  "We may not be able to persuade Hindus that Jesus and not Vishnu should govern\ntheir spiritual horizon, nor Moslems that Lord Buddha is at the center of\ntheir spiritual universe, nor Hebrews that Mohammed is a major prohpet, nor\nChristians that Shinto best expresses their spiritual concerns, to say\nnothing of the fact that we may not be able to get Christians to agree among\nthemselves about their relationship to God.  But all will agree on a\nproposition that they possess profound spiritual resources.  If, in addition,\nwe can get them to accept the further proposition that whatever form the Deity\nmay have in their own theology, the Deity is not only external, but internal\nand acts through them, and they themselves give proof or disproof of the\nDeity in what they do and think; if this further proposition can be accepted,\nthen we come that much closer to a truly religious situation on earth.\n\t\t-- Norman Cousins, from his book \"Human Options\"\n",
