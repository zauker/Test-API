  "Fortune's Rules for Memo Wars: #1\n\n\tAny attempt to say that someone's personal beliefs are wrong, even if\nyou supply conclusive evidence to support your claim, is an outright attack.\nIf you show someone a flaw in his/her logic, they have every right to punch\nyou in the face.  Mathematical proofs of errors are the moral equivalent\nof rape and should be avoided at all cost.\n\tNow... your opponent has requested a \"rational discussion\".  What do\nyou do?  Well, remember that people are normally willing to discuss things\nrationally if and only if you agree with them; anything less would obviously\nnot be rational.  Therefore, agree immediately, and continue as before.\n\tAlways assume that whenever you see someone making a statement about\n\"certain parties who shall remain nameless\", \"some people\", \"assholes\", etc.,\nthey are talking about *you*.  It is also correct to assume that words you\ndon't understand, such as \"prestidigatory\", \"lapidarian\", and \"buprestid\",\nare direct personal attacks aimed at your loved ones and merit an equally\nscathing response.  Failure to do this results in many lost opportunities for\nrational discussion.  (See above.)\n",
  "Fortune's Rules for Memo Wars: #3\n\nThe proper time for a vicious ad hominem attack is when you have no logical\nrecourse.  If you have been arguing a point with a person or persons for\n30 odd weeks, and an memo comes across that logically tears down the\nfinal shred of evidence that you thought you had, that is the time to call\nthe author of that memo:\n\t1: a mindless twit who attacks other people's beliefs for no reason.\n\t2: an egotistical flaming typical wombat aggie melon-humping\n\t   cheese-whizzing nanosexual subuseless clamsucker whose memos\n\t   are apparently sneezed onto his/her terminal.\n\t3: something unpleasant.\nThe OTHER proper time for an ad hominem attack is immediately after someone\nhas posted something you don't understand.  Given the current state of modern\nelectronic communications technology your inability to comprehend the meaning\nof an memo constitutes a violation of western moral tradition on the part of\nthe author of that memo, and the author should be taken to task publicly via\na series of really nasty, name-calling oriented memos.\n",

  "Once upon a time there was a boy, who tried very, very hard to be a Good\nLittle Boy.

More like Ken,\nI suppose.\n\tSo, she lost some friends.  But she loved herself, and that was\nmore important.
