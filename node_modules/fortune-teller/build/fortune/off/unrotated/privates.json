  "A certain bartender decided to try to get a few new customers into his bar\nby starting a gimmick involving a horse.  His claim was that if anyone could\nget the horse to laugh, he would give them drinks on the house.  The idea\nworked well and business improved until one night a young man walked in and\nwhispered in the horse's ear.  The horse immediately burst into hysterical\nlaughter and the man won the contest.  The next night the same thing\nhappened: the man whispered in the horse's ear and the horse burst out\nlaughing.  The next night, the bartender decided to change the rules.  Now,\na person had to get the horse to cry in order to win the drinks on the\nhouse.  Later on that night, the same guy came in and said \"Can I take the\nhorse into the bathroom for a minute?  I promise I'll make him cry.\"  The\nbartender agreed and sure enough, when the man came out leading the horse,\nthe horse was crying his eyes out.  The bartender could take it no more and\nsaid, \"How did you make him laugh the other two nights?\"\n\t\"I told him that my dick was bigger than his\", replied the man.\n\t\"How did you make him cry tonight?\"\n\t\"I proved it.\"\n",

  "Konrad Lorenz, the great animal behaviorist, was scrupulous about cultivating\nfruitful confusion.  Lorenz lived among his research subjects:  dozens of\nspecies of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes.  He did not quantify, control,\nor consciously experiment.  He got to know each creature individually, then\nthrew them together, watching for the unexpected, the unusual, or the bizarre\nin the chaos that followed.  For example, his interest in one of ethology's\nmost important concepts, that of intention movements (motions with meaning,\nsuch as the head bobbing in birds that serves as an alarm signal before\nflight), derived from an inadvertent experiment.  He had trained a free-flying\nraven to eat raw meat from his hand and had been feeding the bird for several\nhours one day.  He would reach into his pants pocket and take out a piece of\nmeat, and the raven would swoop down to grab it in its bill.  By and by, Lorenz\nwent to relieve himself near a hedge.  When the raven saw him put his hand\ninto his pants and pull out another morsel of meat, it swooped down, hungrily\ngrasping the new mouthful in its bill.  Lorenz howled in pain.  But the event\nleft a deep impression on him -- about how faithfully animals respond to\nintention movements, that is.\n\t\t-- The Sciences, May/June, 1988, N.Y. Academy of Science.\n",
