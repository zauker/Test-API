  "Many lower life forms demonstrate qualities that, at first, just don't\nseem survival oriented.  For instance, the female praying mantis, after mating\nwith, well, her mate, will devour him.  For the male praying mantis, however,\nit's a catch-22.  If he mates, he gets screwed out of an opportunity to mate\nagain.  If he doesn't mate, he doesn't reproduce, ending his family tree.  This\nsuicidal behavior is commonly called the Preying Mantis Syndrome -- and many\nlife forms are periodically subject to its wrath.  How did the preying mantis\nbecome stuck in such a awful, vicious cycle?  This is probably what happened:\n\tThe male mantis arrives at the residence of the female mantis.  After\nsome courtship exercises (dinner, a movie, inserting the diaphram) they mate.\nThe female mantis, her lust for... lust being satisfied, relaxes while the\nmale raids the refrigerator and returns home.  This behavior continues until\nthe male and female (mantissas?) establish a permanent relationship.  Then the\nmale establishes a new pattern of behavior:  Football on Mondays, baseball on\nTuesdays, happy hour on Wednesdays, uh, well, uh, working-late-at-the-office\non Thursdays, etc. etc.  The female tolerates this for awhile, then files for\na divorce.  After a long court battle, she concludes one thing:  It simplifies\nmatters tremendously to just eat him when you're done with him.\n\tWell, through the centuries of evolution, the Preying Mantis Syndrome\nhas been carried up to the highest life forms, as well as to humans.  That is\nwhy, one week out of every month, the female of the species will feel compelled\nto bite the head off of the male.  The Syndrome is inescapable, but when it\noccurs in the female of our species, it's best to just avoid them for a while.\n",

Well, one day, as he\nwas chopping fish, he happened to notice that the fish coming towards him on\nthe line looked very familiar.

  "Readers Ask:\n\tIs it possible to kill a vampire with a gun?\n\nVampires are a source of great irritation to the average homeowner and it is\nusually to one's advantage to remove these pests as rapidly as possible.  If\na professional exterminater specializing in the undead is unavailable, it is\npossible to handle the situation with common household items.  However, much\nof the common folklore of vanquishing the undead needs clarifying.  First,\ndriving a sharpened Louisville Slugger through a vampire's heart will NOT kill\nit.  Since it's not quite alive, why would the heart be any different than\npuncturing it in the, for example, left buttock?  Stake driving should be\navoided at any cost since its effect will be to terribly annoy the vampire,\nand the last thing you want on your hands is an irate Lord of Darkness.\nHandguns are also a definite no-no.  Common sense indicates that it requires\nmore to defeat an incarnation of evil than hurling lumps of lead or silver\nthrough its body.  One time-honored method is to expose the vampire to the\nsun, sever its head (any power saw should be sufficient), fill its mouth with\nholy wafers (vanilla wafers over which the Lord's prayer has been read will\ndo in a pinch), immerse the head in an urn filled with holy water, place the\nurn in consecrated lands and bury the rest of the body underneath a crossroad\n(i.e. the intersection of Broad & Chestnut).  Sure, it's a lot of work.  But\nyou'll never have to worry about those damn bats pestering the neighbors again.\n",

  "... So the documentary-makers stick with sharks.  Generally, their procedure\nis to scatter bleeding fish pieces around their boat, so as to infest the\nwaters.

  "The first Great Steward, Parrafin the Climber, was employed in King\nChloroplast's kitchen as second scullery boy when the old King met a tragic\ndeath.  He apparently fell backward by accident on a dozen salad forks.\nSimultaneously the true heir, his son Carotene, mysteriously fled the city,\ncomplaining of some sort of plot and a lot of threatening notes left on his\nbreakfast tray.

  "We ought to be very grateful that we have tools.  Millions of years ago\npeople did not have them, and home projects were extremely difficult. For\nexample, when a primitive person wanted to put up paneling, he had to drive\nthe little paneling nails into the cave wall with his bare fist, so\ngenerally the paneling wound up getting spattered with primitive blood,\nwhich isn't really all that bad when you consider how ugly paneling is to\nbegin with.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"The Taming of the Screw\"\n",

It dates back to a day millions of years ago, when a\ngroup of cavemen were sitting around, watching dinosaurs rot. Suddenly,\nlightning struck a nearby log and set it on fire.  One of the cavemen stared\nat the fire for a few minutes, then said: \"Hey!  Wood heat!\" The other\ncavemen, who did not understand English, immediately beat him to death with\nstones.

  "\tYour home electrical system is basically a bunch of wires that bring\nelectricity into your home and take if back out before it has a chance to\nkill you.  This is called a \"circuit\".  The most common home electrical\nproblem is when the circuit is broken by a \"circuit breaker\"; this causes\nthe electricity to back up in one of the wires until it bursts out of an\noutlet in the form of sparks, which can damage your carpet.  The best way\nto avoid broken circuits is to change your fuses regularly.\n\tAnother common problem is that the lights flicker.  This sometimes\nmeans that your electrical system is inadequate, but more often it means\nthat your home is possessed by demons, in which case you'll need to get a\ncaulking gun and some caulking.  If you're not sure whether your house is\npossessed, see \"The Amityville Horror\", a fine documentary film based on an\nactual book.  Or call in a licensed electrician, who is trained to spot the\nsigns of demonic possession, such as blood coming down the stairs, enormous\ncats on the dinette table, etc.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"The Taming of the Screw\"\n",
