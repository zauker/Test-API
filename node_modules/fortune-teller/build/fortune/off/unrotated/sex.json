  "One night when his charge was pretty high, Micro-Farad decided to\nseek out a cute little coil to let him discharge.  He picked up Milli-Amp\nand took her for a ride on his Megacycle.  They rode across the Wheatstone\nbridge, around the sine waves, and stopped in the magnetic field by the\nflowing current.  Micro-Farad, attracted by Milli-Amp's charactaristic curves,\nsoon had her fully charged and excited, her resistance to a minimum.  He laid\nher on the ground potential, raised her frequency, and lowered her reluctance.\nHe pulled out his high voltage probe and inserted it into her socket,\nconnecting them in parallel and began short circuiting her resistance shunt.\nFully excited, Milli-Amp mumbled:  \"OHM-OHM-OHM.\"\n\tWith his tube operating at a maximum and her field vibrating with\nhis current flow, it caused her shunt to overheat, and Micro-Farad was rapidly\ndischarged and drained of every electron.  They Fluxed all night trying\nvarious connections and sockets until his magnet had a soft core and lost\nall of its field strength.\n\tAfterwards, Milli-Amp tried self-induction  and  damaged  her\nsolenoids.  With his battery fully discharged, Micro-Farad was unable to\nexcite his field, so they spent the night reversing polarity and blowing\neach others fuses.\n\t\t-- Eddie Currents, \"The Sex Life of an Electron\"\n",
