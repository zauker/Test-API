Nobody really\nexpects him to serve time, but nobody seems to think he'll be playing for\nDallas next year either, and a few sporting people who claim to know how the\nNFL works say he won't be playing for ANYBODY next year; that the Commissioner\nis outraged at this mockery of all those Government-sponsored \"Beware of Dope\"\nTV shots that dressed up the screen last autumn.\n\tWe all enjoyed those spots, but not everyone found them convincing.\nHere was a White House directive saying several million dollars would be spent\nto drill dozens of Name Players to stare at the camera and try to stop grinding\ntheir teeth long enough to say they hate drugs of any kind... and then the best\nrunning back in the world turns out to be a goddamn uncontrollable drugsucker.\n\tBut not for long.

  "Deliberate provocation of mystical experience, particularly by LSD and\nrelated hallucinogens, in contrast to spontaneous visionary experiences,\nentails dangers that must not be underestimated.  Practitioners must take\ninto account the peculiar effects of these substances, namely their ability\nto influence our consciousness, the innermost essence of our being.  The\nhistory of LSD to date amply demonstrates the catastrophic consequences that\ncan ensue when its profound effect is misjudged and the substance is mistaken\nfor a pleasure drug.  Special internal and external advance preparations\nare required; with them, an LSD experiment can become a meaningful experience.\n\t\t-- Dr. Albert Hoffman, the discoverer of LSD\n",

  "\tDr. Oliver Wendell Holmes of Harvard Medical School inhaled ether\nat a time when it was popularly supposed to produce such mystical or\n\"mind-expanding\" experiences, much as LSD is supposed to produce such\nexperiences today.  Here is his account of what happened:\n\t\"I once inhaled a pretty full dose of ether, with the determination\nto put on record, at the earliest moment of regaining consciousness, the\nthought I should find uppermost in my mind.  The mighty music of the triumphal\nmarch into nothingness reverberated through my brain, and filled me with a\nsense of infinite possibilities, which made me an archangel for a moment.\nThe veil of eternity was lifted.  The one great truth which underlies all\nhuman experience and is the key to all the mysteries that philosophy has\nsought in vain to solve, flashed upon me in a sudden revelation.  Henceforth\nall was clear: a few words had lifted my intelligence to the level of the\nknowledge of the cherubim.  As my natural condition returned, I remembered\nmy resolution; and, staggering to my desk, I wrote, in ill-shaped, straggling\ncharacters, the all-embracing truth still glimmering in my consciousness.\nThe words were these (children may smile; the wise will ponder):\n`A strong smell of turpentine prevails throughout.'\"\n\t\t-- The Consumers Union Report: Licit & Illicit Drugs\n",
