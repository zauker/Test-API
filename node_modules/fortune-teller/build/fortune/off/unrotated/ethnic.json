As the treaty is signed, and the war\npostponed, almost entirely through the efforts of those three men, an angel\nappears. \"The earth is saved through the efforts of these three men!\nTherefore, I will grant each of them their heart's desire!\"\n\tSo, the angel asks the German for his wish, and the German, recalling\nthe nearness of their disaster, and perceiving the cause to have been the\nRussians, immediately says \"I wish there were no more Russians!\"  And God\nsaid, \"It will be done.\"\n\tThe angel asks the Russian for his wish, which, of course, is \"*I*\nwish there were no more Germans!\"  Replies the angel, \"It will be done.\"\n\tSo the angel asks the Jew for his wish.  The Jew is in a state of\nshock. \"Will you really grant the German's wish?\" he asks, and the angel\navers.  \"And the Russian's, too?\"  The angel avers yet again.  Then the Jew\nthinks a moment, leans back and says, \"In that case, I think I'd like a small\ncup of coffee.\"\n",
  "You always introduce the younger person to the older person, using the\nwording:  \"Miss Brown, I'd like to introduce you to an older person\"\n(unless her name is not \"Miss Brown\").  If you do not know a person's\nage, ask for a driver's license and a major credit card.  If you are\nintroduced to a member of a minority group, use the \"high-five\" style\nhandshake, followed by a remark designed to show you don't mind a bit,\nsuch as \"I see you are a (name of a minority group)!  Good!\"\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"The Stuff of Etiquette\"\n",

  "You can bring men from other parts of the world who are sane.  And you\nknow what happens?  At the very moment they cross those mountains...\nthey go mad.  Instantaneously and automatically, at the very moment\nthey cross the mountains into California, they go insane.\n\t\t-- Quentin Genter\n",
