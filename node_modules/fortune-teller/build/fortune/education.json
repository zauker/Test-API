  "A book is the work of a mind, doing its work in the way that a mind deems\nbest.  That's dangerous.  Is the work of some mere individual mind likely to\nserve the aims of collectively accepted compromises, which are known in the\nschools as 'standards'?  Any mind that would audaciously put itself forth to\nwork all alone is surely a bad example for the students, and probably, if\nnot downright antisocial, at least a little off-center, self-indulgent,\nelitist.  ... It's just good pedagogy, therefore, to stay away from such\nstuff, and use instead, if film-strips and rap-sessions must be\nsupplemented, 'texts,' selected, or prepared, or adapted, by real\nprofessionals.  Those texts are called 'reading material.'  They are the\nacademic equivalent of the 'listening material' that fills waiting-rooms,\nand the 'eating material' that you can buy in thousands of convenient eating\nresource centers along the roads.\n\t\t-- The Underground Grammarian\n",

  "Abstract:\n\tThis study examined the incidence of neckwear tightness among a group\nof 94 white-collar working men and the effect of a tight business-shirt collar\nand tie on the visual performance of 22 male subjects.  Of the white-collar\nmen measured, 67% were found to be wearing neckwear that was tighter than\ntheir neck circumference.  The visual discrimination of the 22 subjects was\nevaluated using a critical flicker frequency (CFF) test.  Results of the CFF\ntest indicated that tight neckwear significantly decreased the visual\nperformance of the subjects and that visual performance did not improve\nimmediately when tight neckwear was removed.\n\t\t-- Langan, L.M. and Watkins, S.M. \"Pressure of Menswear on the\n\t\t   Neck in Relation to Visual Performance.\"  Human Factors 29,\n\t\t   #1 (Feb. 1987), pp. 67-71.\n",

  "Briefly stated, the findings are that when presented with an array of\ndata or a sequence of events in which they are instructed to discover\nan underlying order, subjects show strong tendencies to perceive order\nand causality in random arrays, to perceive a pattern or correlation\nwhich seems a priori intuitively correct even when the actual correlation\nin the data is counterintuitive, to jump to conclusions about the correct\nhypothesis, to seek and to use only positive or confirmatory evidence, to\nconstrue evidence liberally as confirmatory, to fail to generate or to\nassess alternative hypotheses, and having thus managed to expose themselves\nonly to confirmatory instances, to be fallaciously confident of the validity\nof their judgments (Jahoda, 1969; Einhorn and Hogarth, 1978).
