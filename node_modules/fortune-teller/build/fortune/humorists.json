  "A large spider in an old house built a beautiful web in which to catch flies.\nEvery time a fly landed on the web and was entangled in it the spider devoured\nhim, so that when another fly came along he would think the web was a safe and\nquiet place in which to rest.  One day a fairly intelligent fly buzzed around\nabove the web so long without lighting that the spider appeared and said,\n\"Come on down.\"  But the fly was too clever for him and said, \"I never light\nwhere I don't see other flies and I don't see any other flies in your house.\"\nSo he flew away until he came to a place where there were a great many other\nflies.  He was about to settle down among them when a bee buzzed up and said,\n\"Hold it, stupid, that's flypaper.  All those flies are trapped.\"  \"Don't be\nsilly,\" said the fly, \"they're dancing.\"  So he settled down and became stuck\nto the flypaper with all the other flies.\n\nMoral:  There is no safety in numbers, or in anything else.\n\t\t-- James Thurber, \"The Fairly Intelligent Fly\"\n",

One day, the aardvark reflected on the meaning of his life and\nhis career and on the unchecked, catastrophic decline of his nation, its\npathetic excuse for leadership, and the complete ineffectiveness of any\npersonal effort he could make to change the status quo.  Overcome by a\nwave of utter depression and self-doubt, he decided to take the only\ncourse of action that would bring him greater comfort and happiness: he\ndrove to the mall and bought imported consumer electronics goods.\n\nMORAL OF THE STORY:  Invest in foreign consumer electronics manufacturers.\n\t\t-- Tom Annau\n",

  "It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what\nthey seem.  For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed\nthat he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so\nmuch -- the wheel, New York, wars and so on -- whilst all the dolphins\nhad ever done was muck about in the water having a good time.  But\nconversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more\nintelligent than man -- for precisely the same reasons.\n\nCuriously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending\ndestruction of the of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to\nalert mankind to the danger; but most of their communications were\nmisinterpreted ...\n\t\t-- Douglas Admas \"The Hitchhikers' Guide To The Galaxy\"\n",

  "Like you,  I am frequently haunted by profound questions related to man's\nplace in the Scheme of Things.  Here are just a few:\n\n\tQ -- Is there life after death?\n\tA -- Definitely.  I speak from personal experience here.  On New\nYear's Eve, 1970, I drank a full pitcher of a drink called \"Black Russian\",\nthen crawled out on the lawn and died within a matter of minutes, which was\nfine with me because I had come to realize that if I had lived I would have\nspent the rest of my life in the grip of the most excruciatingly painful\nheadache.  Thanks to the miracle of modern orange juice, I was brought back\nto life several days later, but in the interim I was definitely dead.  I\nguess my main impression of the afterlife is that it isn't so bad as long\nas you keep the television turned down and don't try to eat any solid foods.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry\n",

  "\tMy friends, I am here to tell you of the wonderous continent known as\nAfrica.  Well we left New York drunk and early on the morning of February 31.\nWe were 15 days on the water, and 3 on the boat when we finally arrived in\nAfrica.  Upon our arrival we immediately set up a rigorous schedule:  Up at\n6:00, breakfast, and back in bed by 7:00.  Pretty soon we were back in bed by\n6:30.  Now Africa is full of big game.  The first day I shot two bucks.  That\nwas the biggest game we had.  Africa is primerally inhabited by Elks, Moose\nand Knights of Pithiests.\n\tThe elks live up in the mountains and come down once a year for their\nannual conventions.  And you should see them gathered around the water hole,\nwhich they leave immediately when they discover it's full of water.  They\nweren't looking for a water hole.  They were looking for an alck hole.\n\tOne morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas, how he got in my\npajamas, I don't know.  Then we tried to remove the tusks.  That's a tough\nword to say, tusks.  As I said we tried to remove the tusks, but they were\nimbedded so firmly we couldn't get them out.  But in Alabama the Tuscaloosa,\nbut that is totally irrelephant to what I was saying.\n\tWe took some pictures of the native girls, but they weren't developed.\nSo we're going back in a few years...\n\t\t-- Julius H.

If everybody pulled that kind of subversive stunt,\nthe economy would collapse overnight.

  "The basic idea behind malls is that they are more convenient than cities.\nCities contain streets, which are dangerous and crowded and difficult to\npark in.  Malls, on the other hand, have parking lots, which are also\ndangerous and crowded and difficult to park in, but -- here is the big\ndifference -- in mall parking lots, THERE ARE NO RULES.  You're allowed to\ndo anything.  You can drive as fast as you want in any direction you want.\nI was once driving in a mall parking lot when my car was struck by a pickup\ntruck being driven backward by a squat man with a tattoo that said \"Charlie\"\non his forearm, who got out and explained to me, in great detail, why the\naccident was my fault, his reasoning being that he was violent and muscular,\nwhereas I was neither.

For\nsome reason, if a non-hitchhiker discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel\nwith him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a\ntoothbrush, washcloth, flask, gnat spray, space suit, etc., etc.  Furthermore,\nthe non-hitchhiker will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or\na dozen other items that he may have \"lost\".
