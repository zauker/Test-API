  "Oxygen is a very toxic gas and an extreme fire hazard.  It is fatal in\nconcentrations of as little as 0.000001 p.p.m.  Humans exposed to the\noxygen concentrations die within a few minutes.  Symptoms resemble very\nmuch those of cyanide poisoning (blue face, etc.).  In higher\nconcentrations, e.g. 20%, the toxic effect is somewhat delayed and it\ntakes about 2.5 billion inhalations before death takes place.  The reason\nfor the delay is the difference in the mechanism of the toxic effect of\noxygen in 20% concentration.  It apparently contributes to a complex\nprocess called aging, of which very little is known, except that it is\nalways fatal.\n\nHowever, the main disadvantage of the 20% oxygen concentration is in the\nfact it is habit forming.  The first inhalation (occurring at birth) is\nsufficient to make oxygen addiction permanent.  After that, any\nconsiderable decrease in the daily oxygen doses results in death with\nsymptoms resembling those of cyanide poisoning.\n\nOxygen is an extreme fire hazard.

  "There was an old Indian belief that by making love on the hide of\ntheir favorite animal, one could guarantee the health and prosperity\nof the offspring conceived thereupon.  And so it goes that one Indian\ncouple made love on a buffalo  hide.  Nine months later, they were\nblessed with a healthy baby son.  Yet another couple huddled together\non the hide of a deer and they too were blessed with a very healthy\nbaby son.  But a third couple, whose favorite animal was a hippopotamus,\nwere blessed with not one, but TWO very healthy baby sons at the conclusion\nof the nine month interval.  All of which proves the old theorem that:\nThe sons of the squaw of the hippopotamus are equal to the sons of\nthe squaws of the other two hides.\n",
