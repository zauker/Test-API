  "A sharper perspective on this matter is particularly important to feminist\nthought today, because a major tendency in feminism has constructed the\nproblem of domination as a drama of female vulnerability victimized by male\naggression.  Even the more sophisticated feminist thinkers frequently shy\naway from the analysis of submission, for fear that in admitting woman's\nparticipation in the relationship of domination, the onus of responsibility\nwill appear to shift from men to women, and the moral victory from women to\nmen.  More generally, this has been a weakness of radical politics: to\nidealize the oppressed, as if their politics and culture were untouched by\nthe system of domination, as if people did not participate in their own\nsubmission.  To reduce domination to a simple relation of doer and done-to\nis to substitute moral outrage for analysis.\n\t\t-- Jessica Benjamin, \"The Bonds of Love\"\n",
