  "\t... This striving for excellence extends into people's personal\nlives as well.  When '80s people buy something, they buy the best one, as\ndetermined by (1) price and (2) lack of availability. Eighties people buy\nimported dental floss.  They buy gourmet baking soda.  If an '80s couple\ngoes to a restaurant where they have made a reservation three weeks in\nadvance, and they are informed that their table is available, they stalk\nout immediately, because they know it is not an excellent restaurant.  If\nit were, it would have an enormous crowd of excellence-oriented people\nlike themselves waiting, their beepers going off like crickets in the\nnight.  An excellent restaurant wouldn't have a table ready immediately\nfor anybody below the rank of Liza Minnelli.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"In Search of Excellence\"\n",

  "To see the butcher slap the steak, before he laid it on the block,\nand give his knife a sharpening, was to forget breakfast instantly.  It was\nagreeable, too -- it really was -- to see him cut it off, so smooth and juicy.\nThere was nothing savage in the act, although the knife was large and keen;\nit was a piece of art, high art; there was delicacy of touch, clearness of\ntone, skilful handling of the subject, fine shading.

In\nfact, many smart people save the fruitcakes they receive and send them back\nto the original givers the next year; some fruitcakes have been passed back\nand forth for hundreds of years.\n\nThe easiest way to make a fruitcake is to buy a darkish cake, then pound\nsome old, hard fruit into it with a mallet.
